                <p>Florida real estate has always been popular with national and international buyers. We have analyzed
                    the behavior of Florida's real estate market since the big crash in 2008. So the question is, are
                    the Florida real estate market trends indicating a flow of residential buyers, or are we now looking
                    at a stagnant market?</p>

                <p class="dataContentHeading">Florida's Population</p>
                <p>The Florida real estate market is affected by the state’s population growth. Florida is the 3rd most
                    populous state after California and Texas. All of these states have rising real estate markets that
                    are driven by the tremendous population growth. With 21.31 million residents, the population needs
                    housing and that in turn, creates real estate market opportunities.</p>

                <p>If the population growth of approximately 1.8% continues at the same rate, we’re going to witness
                    the state’s population exceed 22 million. The population growth on its own is a vital indicator of
                    the housing and real estate needs of this real estate market.</p>

                <p class="dataContentHeading">Florida's Economy</p>
                <p>Real estate market trends are tremendously affected by each state’s economy. Most notably is
                    Florida’s record-breaking tourism, which has boosted its overall economy. The state’s economy hit
                    the $1 trillion mark in 2018, which is a positive indication of the effect the economy will have on
                    the Florida housing market in 2019.</p>

                <p>Digging into Florida’s economic stats, we find that Florida has the 4th largest economy respectively
                    after California, Texas, and New York. Of course, this economic growth has a direct effect on the
                    Florida real estate market and the employment rates, which brings us to our next point.</p>

                <p class="dataContentHeading">Florida's Jobs and Unemployment</p>
                <p>Once again, Florida is one of the top 10 states for job growth. As Florida’s economy continues to
                    fuel job growth from year to year, the Florida housing market responds at a rapid pace. The above
                    national average job growth is attracting millennials and families from across the country, which
                    automatically increases the population. To compare, Florida’s job growth of 1.3% exceeds the
                    national average of 1.2%.</p>

                <p>This exceptional job growth rate is going to continue increasing in 2019 with the possibility of
                    reaching stability in 2020 and 2021.</p>

                <p class="dataContentHeading">Strong Economical Factors for Florida Real Estate Investors</p>
                <p>When looking for a Florida real estate investment, any investor must look at the economies of the
                    housing market. Moreover, real estate investors are zooming in on microeconomies within Florida’s
                    economy to find the most vibrant location to invest in real estate.</p>

                <p>Accordingly, while examining Florida’s real estate market in 2016, 2017, and 2018, real estate
                    investors can evaluate the accumulative unemployment rate and overall population to make the best
                    real estate investment decision that they can. Of course, the healthy economic system differs
                    between each local real estate market. Let’s take North Palm Beach for example, which has an
                    unemployment rate of 4.8% or Jacksonville Beach with a low unemployment rate of 4.5%. These cities
                    are offering some of the lowest unemployment rates in the state, and the housing market in Florida
                    will keep reflecting that in 2019.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, real estate investing in Florida continues as the need for housing rises with migration,
                    property construction, and incomes increase.</p>

            <div class="dataContent">
                <p class="dataContentHeading">Stability in the Housing Market</p>
                <p>The 2018 Florida housing market was excellent. The sales numbers for single-family homes increased in
                    addition to the median sales price. Moreover, the housing market is becoming more and more catered
                    to the upper-middle class as the inventory of single-family homes under the price tier of $200,000
                    is decreasing. This shortage indicates that real estate developers and investors are focusing on
                    luxury properties, which is natural given the growing economy.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="dataContent">
                <p class="dataContentHeading">Foreign Real Estate Investors</p>
                <p>The state of Florida has been attractive to international homebuyers for several years. As this
                    continues, Florida is becoming a hub for foreign money as they view real estate investing in South
                    Florida as lucrative and secure just as much as its counterparts in Los Angeles and New York State.
                    Accordingly, the major selling point for this real estate market with foreign investors is its
                    affordability when compared to other internationally-dominant US real estate markets.</p>

                <p>Canadian real estate investors are taking a large chunk of international investment in South Florida.
                    The reason for this is mainly due to many Canadian companies opening branches in the Tri-county area
                    in South Florida.</p>

                <p>According to data from the National Association of Realtors, foreign investments in residential real
                    estate properties in South Florida is made up of 46% of Latin American and Caribbean real estate
                    investors.</p>

                <p>As for the housing market predictions in Florida, foreign investors, and their impact on the market
                    may shift if President Trump imposes taxes on Canadian companies in the United States. Additionally,
                    the fact that foreign investors’ interest in any city is strictly financial as they look at the
                    return on investment of everything is an alarming trend. These foreign investors can just as quickly
                    shift to another state.</p>
