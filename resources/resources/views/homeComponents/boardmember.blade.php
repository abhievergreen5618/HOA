                <p>As a homeowner, you have a big stake in the safety and cleanliness of your neighborhood. Perhaps you own a home or condo that’s part of a community that shares common amenities, such as tennis courts, playground, community pool and spa, clubhouse, private roads, sidewalks, utilities and more. How can you ensure that your HOA community will be properly maintained and taken care of? One of the best ways is to become a volunteer board member with your homeowner’s association. HOA committee positions are made up of volunteers however, the satisfaction of knowing your community is being well taken care of gives board members a sense of accomplishment.</p>

                    <li><strong>You have a vested interest in your property. </strong>One of the top priorities of every homeowner is to protect the value of his or her home. Being involved with an HOA will put you in a better position to make and implement rules in your HOA neighborhood. Some of these regulations will directly affect property value, especially if they require decisions about the association’s budget, reserve fund and routine maintenance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Correct problems.</strong> If you are noticing problems in your community, such as lack of maintenance or maybe there’s a problem with unruly neighbors, then you have the opportunity to take charge and help to correct those issues by being a part of the board.</li>
                    <li><strong>Meet more of your expectations.</strong>Did you have certain expectations when you bought your home or condo in the community? Are your expectations being met? By serving on an HOA board, you can achieve your expectations of a more perfect community much sooner by working with your neighbors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gain a better understanding of the by-laws.</strong> Volunteering as a board member will make you well-versed in the HOA by-laws, rules and regulations related to your association. It will also give you a good grasp of operating finances and budgeting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Have fun experiences.</strong>Taking on some of your association’s tasks does not have to be boring. It can be fun, especially when you get to socialize, work with your neighbors and come up with creative ideas on how to make your community run better. Many HOA communities hold get togethers for their residents allowing the community to become more social.</li>
                    <li><strong>Give back to the community.</strong>One way to give back to your neighbors and community is to serve on your homeowners association’s board, which allows you the opportunity to make good decisions that will have a positive impact on all residents.</li>
                    <li><strong>Meet your neighbors.</strong>An HOA meeting is the best place to meet your neighbors and to get to know more about them. It gives you a chance to socialize and make friends with others living in your community.</li>
